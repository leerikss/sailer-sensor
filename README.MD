# sailer-sensor

A small outdated project I did long ago when playing around with a first-generation Raspberry PI,
and a jailbreaked second generation Kindle device.

I noticed that the Kindle E Ink display visibility was excellent in direct sunlight, so I coded a Kindle Java app that
shows my sailboat speed and heading, based on GPS data received by the RPI, and transferred wirelessly.
